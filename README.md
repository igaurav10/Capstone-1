# Airbnb Bookings Analysis - Capstone Project

In this project we are analyzing Airbnbâ€™s New York City(NYC) data of
2019.
Our main objective is to explore and analyze the data to discover key
understandings about listing of properties on the platform. We will
perform basic Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA). We will find out key
metrics that influence every Airbnb listing based on their location,
different hosts and areas, prices, reviews, room type, listing
name, traffic and other related factors.
